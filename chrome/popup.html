        <p>Embed yourself in the very fabric of the web.</p>
        <p>Human Headers is a project to let developers put a little more of themselves into their work without visibly impacting the web.</p>
        <p>To implement your own Human Headers on your project, simply append headers to your responses that match:</p>
        <pre>X-Human-*</pre>
        <p>When you visit a website using Human Headers, you will receive a popup with the message from the developer who left it.</p>
